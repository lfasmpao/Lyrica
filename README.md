**An Open Source SQLite Database Lyrics Android Application**

This application is powered by SQLite Database to store the lyrics of music which you can customize!

To add lyrics to the app you can direcly edit the SQLite file in `/src/main/assets/databases/lyrica.db` and compile the app in Android Studio or equivalent, but also you use APK Editor to edit the SQL and then compile for distribution.


I recommend using this app:
  * [SQLiteBrowser](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser) :octocat:
  * [APK Editor For Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gmail.heagoo.apkeditor&hl=en) :+1:
